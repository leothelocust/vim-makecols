{"name":"Vim-makecols","tagline":"makecols.vim: converting lists to columns made simple","body":"makecols\r\n========\r\n\r\nMakecols.vim is intended to easily convert lists into column based\r\nlayouts.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to explain is with examples.\r\n\r\nSay you have a list of things (in this case numbers)\r\n\r\n    1\r\n    2\r\n    3\r\n    4\r\n    5\r\n    6\r\n    7\r\n    8\r\n    9\r\n    10\r\n\r\nand you’d like it to look neater\r\n\r\n    1       2\r\n    3       4\r\n    5       6\r\n    7       8\r\n    9       10\r\n\r\n[That’s pretty neat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs&feature=youtu.be&t=25s)\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nHere’s how you do it.\r\n\r\nStart with a list like above.\r\n    \r\n    1\r\n    2\r\n    3\r\n    4\r\n    5\r\n    6\r\n    7\r\n    8\r\n    9\r\n    10\r\n\r\nThen visual select the rows you’d like to make neat.\r\n\r\nThen type ```mc``` and viola! The data has automagically been reconstructed\r\ninto a satisfactory arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1       2\r\n    3       4\r\n    5       6\r\n    7       8\r\n    9       10\r\n\r\nYou are now free of the worry caused by inadequate single column list layouts. Carry on.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can do things like ```3mcv``` which would make 3 columns, and arrange to a vertical sorting like so:\r\n\r\n    1       5      9\r\n    2       6      10\r\n    3       7\r\n    4       8\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend\r\ninstalling [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and\r\nthen simply copy and paste:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/.vim/bundle\r\n    git clone git://github.com/leothelocust/vim-makecols.git\r\n\r\nOnce help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with\r\n`:help makecols`.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nJust pull, make some changes, and create a merge request.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) Levi Olson.
