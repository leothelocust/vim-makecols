INTRODUCTION                                    *makecols*

This plugin is a tool for converting lists into columns.

Details follow on the exact semantics, but first, consider the following
examples.  It is assumed that you have selected the "Old text" column.

  Old text                  Command     New text ~
  1                         3mcv        1   4   7
  2                                     2   5
  3                                     3   6
  4
  5                         5mc         1   2   3   4   5
  6                                     6   7

While a few features of this plugin will work in older versions of Vim,
Vim 7 is recommended for full functionality.

MAPPINGS                                        *makecols-mappings*

Make columns is *mc* .  This can be prefaced with the number of columns
to make and suffixed with nothing, *v* , or *h* . However, the default is
horizontal, so specifying *h* would be redundant.

TARGETS                                         *makecols-targets*

The |mc| |mch| and |mcv| commands all take a *linewise* visual selection.
They can be prefaced with a number to specify the number of columns the
output should generate.

REPLACEMENTS                                    *makecols-replacements*

All highlighted text will be removed and replaced by the generated output.

CUSTOMIZING                                     *makecols-customizing*

One can use a global variable for globally available replacements.
>
  let g:makecols_cols = 5                   " default no of cols to 5
  let g:makecols_orientation = "horz"       " default sorting [horz|vert]

ISSUES                                          *makecols-issues*

Vim could potentially get confused when deleting/changing occurs at the very
end of the line.  Please report any repeatable instances of this.
