makecols
========

Makecols.vim is intended to easily convert lists into column based
layouts.

The easiest way to explain is with examples.

Say you have a list of things (in this case numbers)

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10

and youâ€™d like it to look neater

    1       2
    3       4
    5       6
    7       8
    9       10

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/leothelocust/vim-makecols.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help makecols`.
